# DreamSat: Towards a General 3D Model for Novel View Synthesis of Space Objects

[Project Page](https://dream-sat.github.io/) | arXiv (coming soon) 

## Project Overview

Novel view synthesis (NVS) enables to generate new images of a scene or convert a set of 2D images into a comprehensive 3D model. In the context of Space Domain Awareness, since space is becoming increasingly congested, NVS can accurately map space objects and debris, improving the safety and efficiency of space operations. Similarly, in Rendezvous and Proximity Operations missions, 3D models can provide details about a target object's shape, size, and orientation, allowing for better planning and prediction of the target's behavior. 

In this work, we explore the generalization abilities of these reconstruction techniques, aiming to avoid the necessity of retraining for each new scene, by presenting a novel approach to 3D spacecraft reconstruction from single-view images, DreamSat, by fine-tuning the Zero123 XL, a state-of-the-art single-view reconstruction model, on a high-quality dataset of 190 high-quality spacecraft models and integrating it into the DreamGaussian framework. 

We demonstrate consistent improvements in reconstruction quality across multiple metrics, including Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) score (+0.33\%), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) (+2.53\%), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) (+2.38\%), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) (+0.16\%) on a test set of 30 previously unseen spacecraft images.
Our method addresses the lack of domain-specific 3D reconstruction tools in the space industry by leveraging state-of-the-art diffusion models and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. This approach maintains the efficiency of the DreamGaussian framework while enhancing the accuracy and detail of spacecraft reconstructions.

### Dataset

For data, 190 spacecraft 3D models from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), European Space Agency (ESA), and Synthetic Dataset for Satellites (SPE3R) datasets were used. Using the provided Blender file,  extract camera angles and json file using a data format required by Zero123 (https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/zero123).


### Installation/Dependencies

Copy the data over to the GPU server. Clone the zero123 repository and upload the Zero123XL checkpoint. Make sure to update simple.py file to adjust train/validation split.
Run the finetuning (download missing packages if prompted) and save the finetuned model
python main.py \
    -t \
    --base configs/sd-objaverse-finetune-c_concat-256.yaml \
    --gpus 0,1,2,3,4 \
    --scale_lr False \
    --num_nodes 1 \
    --seed 42 \
    --check_val_every_n_epoch 10 \
    --finetune_from zero123-xl.ckpt


Clone the DreamGaussian repository (https://github.com/dreamgaussian/dreamgaussian). Then, upload  checkpoint and config files and adjust model paths in main.py, main2.py, and any other files needed to use the finetuned model instead of the original Zero123XL

CLIP similarity can be calculated through running python -m kiui.cli.clip_sim example_rgba.png example.obj. The script to calculate LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM is provided in this repository.
